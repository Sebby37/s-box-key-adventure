# s-box-key-adventure
Dumb game I made because Garry released some dev keys for S&amp;Box to developers
Made in Pygame on Python 3.8.1
Made by Le Brug#7326 on discord

## Todo (maybe):
- Add one or two more attacks for garry and either randomly choose them or choose the harder ones as the powerups are collected
###### ~~so about those dev keys garry~~
